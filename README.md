## Aim 🎯

⚠️ **Caution:\*\*** This project does not recommend buying or selling any security; it simply tracks BSE "Award of Order / Receipt of Order" announcements for informational purposes.

Bombay Duck keeps a pulse on BSE's "Award of Order / Receipt of Order" announcements so traders can spot fresh bullish catalysts without refreshing the exchange site. The goal is a hands-free tracker that respects BSE rate limits, stores every intraday fetch in git, and keeps the repository's front page as a living dashboard.

## Intraday Snapshot 📊

ℹ️ **Important:\*\*** The README snapshot is updated automatically by the scheduled GitHub Action. Always pull the latest changes (or rebase) before editing README content locally to avoid merge conflicts.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. Scheduled GitHub Action runs at the top of each hour from 09:00 to 16:00 IST, Monday through Friday.
2. Trading-window guard aborts early outside market hours or on weekends/holidays.
3. Node.js fetcher (with throttling and retries) polls the BSE API and archives the raw JSON response.
4. Intraday state manager deduplicates announcements per hour and rolls over automatically at the next market open.
5. Mustache-based renderer injects a fresh table into the README so the latest data is always visible.
6. If anything changed, the workflow commits the README and JSON state back to `main` using a bot token and uploads artifacts for auditing.

## Automation Timeline 🕒

- **09:00 IST**: First eligible run clears out yesterday's state, fetches fresh announcements, and resets the README snapshot.
- **09:15-15:00 IST**: At the top of each hour the workflow repeats the fetch->merge->render pipeline, committing only when new data appears.
- **After 15:00 IST**: Guard step exits successfully; the last intraday snapshot remains until markets reopen.
